== Your {doctitle}

NOTE: We assume you've reviewed available technologies and found image:../../images/cloudfoundry.png[Cloud Foundry, link="http://cloudfoundry.org/index.html"] to be a good choice. 

=== Introduction

To make use of the princles of cloud computing, it's vital to be able to deploy business applications to a cloud computing service. These applications typically let our customers conduct business with us. The services we provide to them can be built upon layers of technologies that are based on standards used by the industry. 

Solutions like http://cloudfoundry.org/index.html[Cloud Foundry] Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS), offer a standard set of features, services and attachment points.
