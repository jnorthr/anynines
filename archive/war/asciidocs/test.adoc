.Feeding the Werewolves
====
While werewolves are hardy community members, keep in mind the following dietary concerns:

This is your control panel. You can log in here using your email address and password credentials. From this panel, you can set up secure network credentials, look up your billing information about your account, and learn how to use tools on a computer console that control your applications. When you're more familiar with our Anynines services, you might want to do that, but for now, we want to take you on a short-cut path to quickly deploy an application on our service.

Don't worry about organizations or spaces until you've learned a bit more. We've set up your account with some typical values just to get started more quickly.
