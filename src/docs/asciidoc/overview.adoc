== http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/overview.html[Service Brokers]

image:broker.svg[service Brokers,100] Components responsible for persistence services. It creates an instance of a particular service, say RabbitMQ messaging and attaches that service to an application. A human developer or manager guides this component in the binding of a service instance to a specific application.

== https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/messaging-nats.html[Message Bus]

image:NATbus.svg[Messaging,100] An internal system messaging service, or bus, written in Ruby, offers message transfers between system componnts. The *NATS* publish-subscribe queueing technology is used here.
